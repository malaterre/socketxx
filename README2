Socket++-1.11ln
---------------

This is a modified version 1.11 of the Socket++ library. I had to change
the source code a bit to make it compile with egcs-2.91.66 and gcc-2.96
(Linux). This modified code will not necessarily compile under other
platforms than Linux (i386). It has not been tested.

If this code happens to compile with your compiler, that's good. But if
it doesn't, I really can't help you. I actually even don't know very
well how the code works, I just changed the lines that wouldn't compile.
